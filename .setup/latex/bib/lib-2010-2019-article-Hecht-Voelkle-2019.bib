  abstract = {The analysis of cross-lagged relationships is a popular approach in prevention research to explore the dynamics between constructs over time. However, a limitation of commonly used cross-lagged models is the requirement of equally spaced measurement occasions that prevents the usage of flexible longitudinal designs and complicates cross-study comparisons. Continuous-time modeling overcomes these limitations. In this article, we illustrate the use of continuous-time models using Bayesian and frequentist approaches to model estimation. As an empirical example, we study the dynamic interplay of physical activity and health, a classic research topic in prevention science, using data from the “Midlife in the United States (MIDUS 2): Daily Stress Project, 2004–2009.” To help prevention researchers in adopting the approach, we provide annotated R scripts and a simulated data set based on the results from analyzing the MIDUS 2 data.},
