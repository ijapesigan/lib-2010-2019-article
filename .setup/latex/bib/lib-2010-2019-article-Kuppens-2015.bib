  abstract = {The study of affect dynamics aims to discover the patterns and regularities with which emotions and affective experiences and
components change across time, the underlying mechanisms involved, and their potential relevance for healthy psychological
functioning. The intention of this special section is to serve as a mini handbook covering the contemporary state of research into
affect dynamics. Contributions address theoretical viewpoints on the origins and functions of emotional change, methodological
and modeling approaches, biological and social perspectives on affect dynamics, and the downstream consequences for well-being
and psychopathology.},
